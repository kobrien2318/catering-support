<section id="about">
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Kevin Oâ€™Brien launched this service with a clear mission: to bring reliable, world-class phone support to local catering teams during their busiest moments. An Indianapolis native with a background in customer & food service and a deep respect for the fast-paced nature of the catering world, he created a small Indiana-based company dedicated to filling that gap: remote, on-call phone support for caterers when itâ€™s needed most. Whether you're managing a full calendar of events or just need help covering the phones during a weekend rush, our goal is simple â€” to ensure every client call gets the attention it deserves.</p>

<section id="how">
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>We operate as an on-call extension of your team. No outsourcing, no call centers. When your main line rings and you're unavailable, calls forward directly to us. We answer promptly under your business name, gather key details from the inquiry, and handle next steps based on your preferences.</p>
</section>

<section id="faq">
  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <p><span class="highlight">Is this only for large caterers?</span><br>
  Not at all. While many of our clients run large operations, we also support smaller, independent caterers. If your phone gets busy and you want to make sure no inquiry falls through the cracks, this service is for you.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">How much does it cost?</span><br>
  We offer flexible packages based on your call volume and hours of coverage. Pricing is simple, competitive, and always tailored to your needs. A first time client discount is available -- schedule a free consultation to learn more.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">When do you answer calls?</span><br>
 We answer calls that are forwarded to us â€” typically during peak hours, after-hours, or anytime you're unavailable and need backup. You stay in control of when calls forward. Weâ€™re here as an extension of your team when you need coverage, not a replacement for your day-to-day operations.</p>
