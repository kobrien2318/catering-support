<section id="about">
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Kevin Oâ€™Brien launched this service with one goal: to bring reliable, world-class phone support to local catering teams during their busiest moments. An Indianapolis native with a background in customer service, food service, and a deep respect for the fast-paced nature of both industries, Kevin built a small Indiana-based company dedicated to one thing: on-call, remote phone support for caterers â€” right when it's needed most. Whether you're managing a packed event calendar or just need backup during a weekday or weekend rush, our goal is simple: to make sure every client call gets the attention it deserves.</p>

<section id="how">
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>We act as an on-call extension of your team â€” no outsourcing, no call centers. When your main line rings and you're unavailable, calls forward directly from your phone system to ours. We answer promptly, gather essential details, and follow next steps based on your operating procedures.</p>
</section>

<section id="faq">
  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <p><span class="highlight">Is this only for large caterers?</span><br>
  Not at all. While many of our clients run large operations, we also support smaller, independent caterers. If your phone gets busy and you want to make sure no inquiry falls through the cracks, this service is for you.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">How much does it cost?</span><br>
  We offer flexible packages based on your call volume and hours of coverage. Pricing is simple, competitive, and always tailored to your needs. A first time client discount is available â€” schedule a free consultation to learn more.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">When do you answer calls?</span><br>
 We answer calls that are forwarded to us â€” typically during peak hours, after-hours, or anytime you're unavailable and need backup. You stay in control of when calls forward. Weâ€™re here as an extension of your team when you need coverage, not a replacement for your day-to-day operations.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">What exactly does your service provide?</span><br>
 We offer remote customer support for catering teams to cover overflow, after-hours, and urgent calls â€” ensuring every client inquiry is answered professionally without adding to your in-house staffing.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">How is your service scheduled?</span><br>
Flexible options include hourly, monthly packages, or event-based scheduling with no long-term contracts ever required. Details discussed during the consultation or onboarding to tailor the best fit for your needs.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Can/do you sound like our team?</span><br>
Absolutely. We answer calls using your brand voice and script guidelines to maintain consistency, quality, and customer experience.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">How do I get started?</span><br>
Reach out via phone, email, or schedule a free phone consultation through our Calendly link.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">What if we only need occasional help?</span><br>
No problem! You can book as little as one hour with no ongoing commitments.</p>
