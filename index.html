    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Q: Will my team lose control?</dt>
        <dd>A: No, absolutely not‚Äîyou approve all major decisions and an open line of communication is always kept with your team. Our services act as an extension of your team.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How much does your service cost?</dt>
        <dd>A: The initial consultation is free, and it is in this consultation where needs and associated costs would be discussed.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How quickly can services start?</dt>
        <dd>A: Upon closing, services can begin in as little as 24 hours. Most clients will begin receiving services within 24-48 hours. It is recommended to schedule a consultation at least 48 hours in advance of a known high volume day.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Do you work with small caterers?</dt>
        <dd>A: Absolutely! We do offer scalable and flexible solutions for caterers of all sizes.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Are there any contracts involved?</dt>
        <dd>A: Not if you don't need one. Our service is so flexible, you could use them on a pay-as-you-go or contract basis -- whichever fits your needs most. If the event required, services could be used for as little as a full operating day of your business.</dd>
